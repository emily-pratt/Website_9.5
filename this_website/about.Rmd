title: "About Emily Pratt"
---

Hi! My name is Emily and I'm a master's student studying biochemistry at the University of New Hampshire. As an undergrad here, I majored in Biochemistry, Molecular and Cellular Biology. I'm working on a drug combination to treat triple negative breast cancer in the lab of Dr. Sarah Walker. 
I grew up in Beverly, Massachusetts which is less than an hour from UNH! Outside of school I love to run and on the weekends I travel to see my younger brother's college lacrosse games. 
Here is a picture of me and my mom at my undergraduate graduation from UNH this past May! She also went to UNH!
